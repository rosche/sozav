The original inspiration of the project was to play with genetic programming for the AIs.  I've worked\r\non it in spurts over the years, but still haven't gotten to the genetic programming!\r\n\r\nThe game has a very crude AI.  I intentionally haven't been trying to improve the AI -- see references to\r\ngenetic programming above.  That said I'd welcome improved hand-crafted AIs if somebody wants to work on them\r\n\r\nCurrently the UI for the game is entirely text-based.  I've got a server running under a telnet daemon\r\nat [telnet://jones.argon.org:8000](telnet://jones.argon.org:8000) you can use to try it out.\r\n\r\nThe next big thing I'd like to work on is a web-based interface.\r\n\r\nRoderick Schertler <roderick@argon.org>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
