- things you should be able to do but can't

    - choose which gem to destroy for a magic mirror or shadow cloak
      (currently it destroys the most epensive one)

    - choose which knowledge track to advance if you get a free advancement
      (currently it always uses the most expensive one), and allow choosing
      owned but unassigned knowledge chips

    - explicity choose what to pay with, if you want

- rules not implemented yet

    - you can sell gems, increase knowledge of gems, then buy gems, but
      you shouldn't be able to
    - you can't combine purchases to prevent losing a dust
    - you can auction a magic mirror or shadow cloak even if you have no
      active gems

- knapsack problems

    - make dust (due to lack of 1 dust)
    	- cost minimized
	- value <= and maximized
    - make dust with hand limit
    	- cost <= and minimized
	- value <= and maximized
    - pay energy
    	- cost maximized
    	- value >= X but as little over as possible
	    - actually want to minimize the hand count of the resulting
	      overpayment combined with existing dust
    	    - sometimes you might want to save the 1 dust, sometimes to
    	      maximize your hand limit.  I think you have to ask the
    	      player if it matters.
	- I think the result can change if you combine purchases vs. doing
	  the same individually, so how to implement combining purchases?

    - label toad/raven artifacts as such in their descriptions

- todo
    - option for which turn order cards to use
    - undo
    - show things you can afford to do
    - search for die/croak, deal more gracefully with some of them
    - many assertion-type tests

- rules to remember

    - faq says
	- The phases 3a, 3b and 3c may be done in any order, although you may
	  NOT split any of the phases, like selling
	  gems (3a), increase gems knowledge (3b) and then buy gems (3a again).
      but it also earlier says
    - player 1 penalty applies if anybody has 10 points (eg another
      player won an auction on player 1's turn and player 1 goes again)?
      It says this in rules 2.0.  It would also apply to poisitions 5
      and 6, but position 2's penalty only applies if position 2 has 10
      points.

- questions
    - 9 sages -- what if you can make the gem (spellbook for emerald,
      level 3 fire druid for ruby) but haven't?
    - are gems limited?
    - is dust limited?
    - can't hand limit go over 13 if you have multiple crystal balls?
    - what happens if you run out of cards?


- user interface

    - cbreak interface
    - network interface
    	- inetd version, just like stdio version
	- standard runner with -M...Game -e ...Game->run or such
    	- prompt about number of players, options, character selection
    - y/n/Y/N questions (Y == y and do this from now on)
    - list of options (enchant gem, auction, disactivate gems, etc)
    	- some with sublist of options (which type to enchant, what to
    	  auction, what to disactivate)
    - numeric (auction)
    - informational message
    	- but to display things graphically you'll need this to be
    	  non-textual as well

- algorithm for picking energy

Hi, Dominus.  I'm writing a version of the board game The Scepter of
Zavandor (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/13884) and I could use some
help with an algorithm.  The problem seems tricky to me, but I wouldn't
be surprised if it had a name and a web site dedicated to it.  I was
hoping you might point me in the right direction.

The player has a group of items which have 2 non-negative integer
properties I'll call $cash and $size.  At certain points during the
game the user isn't allowed to have more than a certain sum of $size
from all their items, so generally you want to hold on to items which
have a high $cash/$size ratio.

There are 2 types of subset picking I need to do with these items.  I'd
guess these are related and might be solved with the same algorithm with
different parameters, but I'm not sure.

    1. When buying something you have to pay a certain amount of
       $cash, and you can get change but only in some (very poor
       ratio) demoninations.  After paying and getting your change
       you'd like to have the smallest total $size you can.

    2. When getting down to your $size limit you want to do it while
       holding on to as much $cash as possible.  This part isn't as
       important (doesn't come up often) because of some other factors
       in the game.

As an added wrinkle, 1 $cash change isn't always available, so you want
to try not to lose that $1 if possible.  (This is an option which will
be true or false for the whole game.)  If the algorithm had to ignore
this part to be simpler that would be okay.

To make things concrete, the items available are like this:

    $cash       $size   ratio   type
    -----       -----   -----   -------------
    1           1       1       dust (used as change)
    2           1       2       dust (used as change)
    5           2       2.5     dust (used as change)
    10          3       3.3     dust (used as change)
    3-17        1       3-17    card
    20-60       3       6.7-20  concentrated

If you can share any thoughts about this I'd be very grateful.
