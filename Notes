- rules to remember

    - 5 ruby limit
    - diamond from elixir goes to the pentagon, only activated on your
      turn
    - faq says
	- The phases 3a, 3b and 3c may be done in any order, although you may
	  NOT split any of the phases, like selling
	  gems (3a), increase gems knowledge (3b) and then buy gems (3a again).
      but it also earlier says
    - player 1 penalty applies if anybody has 10 points (eg another
      player won an auction on player 1's turn and player 1 goes again)?
      It says this in rules 2.0.  It would also apply to poisitions 5
      and 6, but position 2's penalty only applies if position 2 has 10
      points.

- questions
    - are gems limited?

- todo
    - undo
    - show things you can afford to do
    - search for die/croak, deal more gracefully with some of them
    - many assertion-type tests

- variations to implement

    - select character
    - multiple of same character
    - 1 dust chits
    - which 1/2/3/4/5/6 cards to use
    - no randomness in cards, always average
    - reduced randomness in cards
    - no or reduced randomness in cards, but only for X rounds
    	- perhaps pick out 3+7 sapphires, include them when reshuffling
    - changes in Z-Man version
	- druid gets or doesn't get 3rd level bonus
    	- 9 sages cards turn into dust if you can't buy that type of gem
	  (Or produce that card?  What if you had a crystal of
	  protection, eg?)
    - restricted order of actions on your turn
    - bid for characters http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/29499
    - fire 3 ruby for any player
    - no druid fire 3 ruby
    - don't turn 9 sages cards into dust
    - no druid except in a 6 player game
