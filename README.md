sozav - "The Scepter of Zavandor" board game
============================================

This is an implementation of
[The Scepter of Zavandor](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13884/the-scepter-of-zavandor)
board game.  The original inspiration of the project was to play with genetic programming for the AIs.  I've worked
on it in spurts over the years, but still haven't gotten to the genetic programming!

The game has a very crude AI.  I intentionally haven't been trying to improve the AI -- see references to
genetic programming above.  That said I'd welcome improved hand-crafted AIs if somebody wants to work on them

Currently the UI for the game is entirely text-based.  I've got a server running under a telnet daemon
at [telnet://jones.argon.org:8000](telnet://jones.argon.org:8000) you can use to try it out.

The next big thing I'd like to work on is a web-based interface.
